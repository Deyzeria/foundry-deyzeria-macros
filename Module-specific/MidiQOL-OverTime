Stackable effects

You can refer to ##/@stackCount 
for stackable effects which can be used in active effect evaluation. 
Since you almost always want to refer to the stackCount on the target, for non-passive effects remember to use ##stackCount 
so it will evaluate on the target not the caster/attacker and for passive effects @stackCount.
